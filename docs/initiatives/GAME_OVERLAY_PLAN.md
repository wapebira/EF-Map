# EF-Map Game Overlay Initiative

## Sync Checklist (when updating this plan)
1. Apply the change to this file (`EF-Map-main/docs/initiatives/GAME_OVERLAY_PLAN.md`).
2. Mirror the identical change in `ef-map-overlay/docs/initiatives/GAME_OVERLAY_PLAN.md` within the same session.
3. Record a brief entry in both decision logs if the update reflects roadmap movement (reference the same ISO date/title in each).
4. Call out any cross-repo code impact in your status summary so the operator can trace dependencies quickly.


## 1. Purpose
- Provide an in-game overlay for EVE Frontier that surfaces a focused subset of EF Map data (initially routing information).
- Preserve the existing web app while enabling players to summon an overlay on demand without restarting the game client.
- Document an implementation roadmap using an in-process DirectX 12 hook coordinated by a locally installed helper application.

## 2. Scope
- **In scope:** Windows helper app, DX12 overlay DLL, communication bridge from the EF Map web UI, packaging and first-run experience, feasibility spike that renders arbitrary content in-game.
- **Out of scope (for now):** Production UI design, full routing workflow inside the overlay, multi-client coordination, anti-cheat negotiations.

## 3. Assumptions
- EVE Frontier remains free of anti-cheat/anti-injection protections or the developers explicitly permit this helper.
- Users are comfortable installing a signed helper app and launching EF Map in a desktop browser.
- We control distribution of the overlay helper (no third-party storefront requirements).

## 4. Target User Flow
1. Player runs EVE Frontier (any display mode).
2. Player opens the EF Map web app in a browser and calculates a route.
3. Player clicks **“Open in game overlay”**.
4. Browser triggers the local helper (custom protocol + localhost API).
5. Helper injects the overlay DLL into the existing EF process; overlay appears and can be moved/resized.
6. When finished, player hides or detaches the overlay via hotkey or web UI.

## 5. Architecture Overview
| Component | Responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Web app (unchanged core) | Adds overlay CTA, detects helper availability (poll localhost), serializes minimal payload (e.g., current route ID). |
| Overlay helper (tray app) | Registers custom URL protocol, hosts localhost HTTP endpoint, injects overlay DLL on demand, manages updates and settings. |
| DX12 overlay DLL | Hooks `IDXGISwapChain` present, renders overlay (ImGui or similar), handles input routing, exposes IPC back to helper/web. |
| Packaging & updates | MSI/MSIX installer, Authenticode signing, auto-update channel (optional).

### Communication pairing
- **Custom protocol** `ef-overlay://attach?session=<token>` for explicit actions from the browser.
- **Local HTTP API** `http://127.0.0.1:<port>/status`, `/attach`, `/dismiss` for health checks and richer commands.

## 6. Progress Summary (2025-10-01)
- ✅ **Helper + injector MVP** – C++ helper boots, exposes HTTP API, launches overlay smoke script, injects DX12 module with hotkey toggle.
- ✅ **DX12 overlay hook** – Swap-chain hook renders ImGui window, handles input capture (F8 toggle, drag/move, edge resize) without impacting gameplay.
- ✅ **Automation** – PowerShell smoke script coordinates helper launch, payload post, and DLL injection for quick manual validation.
- ✅ **Overlay state v2 schema + event queue** – Shared-memory schema updated with player marker, highlights, camera pose, HUD hints, follow flag; overlay <-> helper event ring buffer published via shared memory + HTTP drain endpoint for testing.
- ▢ **Installer & signing** – Deferred until we stabilize feature set; helper currently launched manually.
- ▢ **Browser CTA** – Web → helper bridge still manual; custom protocol & detection flow to be designed.

## 7. Phase 2 – Native Content Integration (Next milestones)
Focus: transform the overlay from a text HUD into a native starfield view synchronized with the EF-Map web app, while laying groundwork for bidirectional controls.

> **Guiding principle:** the overlay should complement, not clone, the browser app. Prioritize context-aware cues (live system updates, safety alerts, quick actions) that keep pilots in-game without alt-tabbing. Multi-monitor users already have full EF-Map; our differentiator is immediacy and automation tied to game state.

### 7.0 Helper runtime UX shell *(new priority)*
Deliver a lightweight tray experience around the existing helper runtime so operators can launch, monitor, and control the overlay without touching console windows.

1. **Runtime extraction** – Factor current helper process control into a reusable `HelperRuntime` that can be driven by both console and tray entry points.
2. **Tray UI scaffold** – Add a notification-area app with start/stop, inject, and "post sample state" commands, plus status indicator for overlay attachment and event activity.
3. **Smoke tooling refresh** – Update `tools/overlay_smoke.ps1` to launch the tray shell automatically and exercise sample payload + injection flows.
4. **Diagnostics hooks** – Surface quick links for logs/config folders and report last error in the tray tooltip to simplify manual testing.

> Packaging/signing remain deferred; this milestone ships a developer-quality shell only, ensuring future features (log watcher, event bridge) have a visible home.

### 7.1 Data & messaging contracts
1. **Overlay state v2 spec** *(EF-Map-main & helper)*
   - ✅ Schema expanded with camera pose, player marker, highlights, HUD hints, follow flag, and active node tracking.
   - ✅ Shared-memory payload version bumped to v2 with parser/serializer coverage.
2. **Overlay ↔ helper events** *(helper & overlay)*
   - ✅ Shared-memory ring buffer publishes overlay-generated events; helper polls and exposes `/overlay/events` for downstream consumers.
   - ⏳ Wire helper-to-browser forwarding (HTTP/WebSocket) and auth story for event delivery into EF-Map web app.

### 7.2 Rendering pipeline
3. **Star catalog asset** *(EF-Map-main tooling)*
   - Export compact binary (positions, system_id, name hashes) from existing map data.
   - Helper packages asset and provides checksum/version handshake to overlay.
4. **Native starfield renderer spike** *(overlay DLL)*
   - Upload static buffers (stars as instanced point sprites) and draw polyline routes with lightweight shaders.
   - Match EF-Map aesthetics (brightness falloff, selection glow) and ensure <1 ms GPU cost per frame.
5. **HUD controls** *(overlay DLL & helper)*
   - Build ImGui panel with buttons/toggles for follow-mode, overlay opacity, route step actions.
   - Confirm focus handling (keyboard navigation, text input) and end-to-end event delivery back to the web app.

### 7.3 Live data inputs & telemetry
6. **Game log watcher** *(helper)*
   - Monitor the Frontier gamelog directory (handle rotation), parse system-change lines, and resolve system names to canonical EF identifiers.
   - Publish player location into the overlay state (opt-in toggle), flush updates through the shared memory channel, and fan out to the EF-Map web client via the event bridge.
   - Harden against noise (chat/combat spam), missing logs, and concurrent clients; document fallback behaviour when logging is disabled.
7. **Combat telemetry overlay** *(helper & overlay)*
   - Tail combat logs to aggregate inbound/outbound DPS in rolling windows and surface quick-glance charts inside the overlay.
   - Provide ImGui-based gauges/graphs, reset heuristics (dock, jump), and privacy controls for pilots who opt out.
   - Reuse the watcher infrastructure for alerting hooks (e.g., spike detection) without blocking the main render thread.
8. **Browser integration** *(EF-Map-main)*
   - Detect helper availability, expose “Open in overlay” CTA, push state updates via HTTP/WebSocket.
   - Handle overlay events (e.g., mark waypoint done) and refresh UI accordingly.

### 7.4 Packaging & UX (deferred until feature complete)
9. **Installer & production tray polish** *(helper)*
   - Convert the developer tray shell into a signed distribution (MSI/MSIX) once core features stabilize.
   - Layer in auto-update, first-run guidance, and per-display profiles for end users.
   - Fold settings panes (hotkeys, log watcher toggles) into the tray UI once the underlying capabilities are complete.

## 8. Tooling & Tech Stack
- Language: C++20 for DLL & helper core (optionally C# for helper UI via WinUI 3).
- Hooking: MinHook or Microsoft Detours (DX12 friendly).
- UI: ImGui (prototype) → evaluate Ultralight/CEF for HTML rendering.
- Installer: WiX Toolset (MSI) or MSIX + self-updater (Squirrel/Electron-builder) later.
- Signing: OV/EV Authenticode certificate via DigiCert/Sectigo.
- Logging: spdlog / ETW for DLL; helper log file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%/EFOverlay`.

## 9. Risks & Mitigations
| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| Future anti-cheat introduction | Keep relations with devs, add safety kill-switch, disable overlay if blocked. |
| GPU instability or crashes | Minimal overlay pipeline, robust error handling, ability to unhook quickly. |
| Security concerns (malicious sites hitting helper endpoint) | Require CSRF tokens, origin checks, short-lived session keys. |
| User trust | Signed binaries, transparent documentation, opt-in install/uninstall, open-source helper code. |
| Multi-client conflicts | Support per-process attach requests, guard against double injection. |

## 10. Open Questions
- Preferred helper UI framework (WinUI vs native Win32).
- Should overlay auto-attach when EF launches or stay opt-in per session?
- Long-term plan for delivering overlay UI (ImGui vs HTML to texture). Investigate HTML embedding cautiously (WebView2/CEF carry large footprints and potential anti-cheat scrutiny) once native renderer is stable.
- Deployment pipeline hosting (GitHub Releases vs custom CDN).
- How to synchronize route data securely (JWT token exchange? local ephemeral key?).

## 11. Next Steps
1. Ship the helper tray shell MVP (runtime extraction, tray UI, smoke tooling refresh).
2. Prototype the helper log watcher + location toggle, exposing status through the tray.
3. Bridge helper event queue to EF-Map web client once the tray/log watcher are stable.
4. Stand up the combat telemetry overlay using the shared watcher pipeline.
5. Implement star catalog export and native renderer spike (overlay repo).
6. Design browser CTA & helper discovery flow; mirror plan updates in `EF-Map-main`.
7. Revisit packaging milestone once native rendering & event loop prove stable.
